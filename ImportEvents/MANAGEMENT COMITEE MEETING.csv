2.  Head Office info related to SSD/Syndicated business (email F. Fu dd. 27.09.2013) 
     - H.O. prefers to do business less than 3 years
     - H.O. wants CCB Frankfurt Branch to act as arranger and not as participant
     - If the amount of the Syndicated loan is less than €/US 100 mil. approval is not to be expected 

     Mr. Gilhaus outlined that:
     - most syndicated loans have a tenor of 3,5,7 or 10 years. Syndicated loans with a duration less 
        than 3 years are unusual in the daily business.
     - the marketing position of CCB Frankfurt is not strong enough to act as a leader or arranger for 
        syndicated loans (low dotation captial) which does not allow us to absorb the the credit risk 
     - numerous loans of medium scaled customers are below € 100 million

     With regard to the strong regulations of the H.O., most invitations do not match their conditions.
     Therefore the loans mentioned in Mr. Gilhaus attachment dd. 07.10.2013 cannot be proceeded 

3. Presentation Dong Fu on the following tables/figures in 2013:
     - expired loans               US $      1.301.660.101.86
     - non expired loans      US $          997.268.634.61
     - total loans                     US $      2.298.928,736.47

     Mr. Fu explained that due to our CAR limitation there won’t be space for new authorized payments 
     in the future. Mr Fu says that EALLC and prefinance are two  possible options to increase the bank’s 
     assets. Due to the competition with 3 other overseas branches it is necessary to lower the margin 
     and increase the business volume in order to meet the budget. Nevertheless, he believes that due 
     to the cooperation with foreign banks, lowering the margin would result in 30-40 BPS. 
     Furthermore, Mr. Fu informed about the liability surplus as per 04.10.2013:    373 M USD

4. Credit Administration
     Mrs. Ping Li states that all necessary info regarding article 18 KWG has been received and analyzed 
     and is ready for inspection. 

5. IT
     Mr. Papas is currently testing the Multibank platform. He would like to go live in November 2013.
     The internal IT audit, carried out by Prüfungs- und Beratungsgesellschaft stated that the PS tool
     generated by Mr. Papas meets the programming requirements. Mr. Papas is required to issue a
     full workflow procedure and to describe the programming and testing. 

6. Risk Controlling
     Mr. Nieli is currently preparing the risk controlling figures for the 3rd quarter 2013.
     So far he has not encountered any problems. The capital ratio is stable over 8.5. Only low risk 
     businesses are executed. All key controlling figures are met. A power point presentation shall
     be prepared.

7. Treasury
     Mr. Xiadong Wang informed about the EUR USD Swap Deals which generated a profit of € 3.000
     within one week. Based on our last discussions Mr. Wang expects the approval to purchase 
     German Treasury Notes and asked Mr. Papas (IT) to instal a test environment.
     Mr. Wang further informed that other chinese banks are allowed to issue commercial papers with
     a duration of 3 - 6 months. He suggested for further investigations and to consider this product also
     for our Branch.

8. Foreign Department
     Mr. Ott informed that numerous collection based payments from our chinese branches related to 
     VW /Audi transactions are still unsettled. He shall approach VW/Audi to continue sending letters to
     CCB China and their own Joint Ventures in China to speed up the settlement process.
     Mr. Ott also shall evaluate further business possibilities to generate additional income out of FX spot
     transactions and financings related to Jilin Branch (VW/Audit) transactions.
     Mr. Ott shall furthermore explore marketing opportunities with well performing medium sized 
     corporates.

9. General Information

    End of October 2013 our Chairman Mr. Hongzhang Wang and the Vice President of CCB Beijing shall 
    visit Deutsche Bundesbank and the Ministry of Economics in Wiesbaden. The goal of the visit is to
    express CCB´s strong interest be the RMB clearing bank for the financial Market Place Frankfurt.

    deposits up to 100 m n total. This amount was restricted by Senior Management internally to € 65 m.

future anymore. Therefore we need to get prepared for such a scenario and to plan some counteractions to maintain a sufficient liquidity ratio under this scenario . 
In 2014 new extensive regulations (CRR) will be in force. Risk Management/Accounting  and Credit Administration shall get familiar with the relevant new rules. 
The ""similiar supervision status of China´s Supervisory Banking Authority"" had been discussed. Since - according to the nowadays regulation - China has not
a similiar comparable banking regulatory status to Germany. Therefore lendings to Chinese banks starting in 2014 cannot exceed 25% (€ 18.4 m) of our dotation capital (€ 73.9 m). ";"Sternheimer

The new rating tool is very time consuming and detailed
Each branch or subsidiary is ordered to finish the new rating within the first half of 2014 - therefore a detailed action plan is required to finish the work in time. 
According to HO guidelines the borrower rating should be executed by Credit Marketing. This is not in line with our daily practice - Credit Administration is 
exercising the rating task.

ACCOUNTING 
Profit end of January (1.5 m €) is mainly due to FX trading and needs to be analyzed

TREASURY : 
Profits gained via one year FX dealings related to FX or spot forwards with CCB Fujian and CCB Xiamen. CCBF earned 100 bps on average per deal.   
CCB H.O. encourages CCB Frankfurt to purchase Chinese bonds and securities, but power of attorney - for the time being -  allows us government bond purchase only. 

Marketing I: 
SSD offer related to France had to be rejected because of missing limits.  

FOREIGN DEPARTMENT 
All interim accounts are cleared. Due to booking procedure (booking of FX transactions same day value - booking of the financing transactions with CCB mainland branches with prevalue two days)  Cpd account is technically affected (overdraft). 
Foreign Department is obliged to adjust and set off the interims Accounts daily and to document and monitor the technical overdrafts daily. 

RISK CONTROLLING 
Liquidity key figure on 31.01.2014 amounted to 1.16. Treasury and Risk Controlling had been ordered to closely follow and plan the liquditiy daily comfortably so that the bank does not violate the minimum liquidity ratio of 1. 
Without HO clearing money the liquidity ratio would be around 1,06.

Foreign Dept got impression that those already concluded deals should be reversed and stopped.  Instead of avoiding a forseeable loss by asking Senior Management's final decision in this matter, Foreign Dept deceided on their own  without prior final approval of Senior Management.

According to statitic of Treasury Dept, the existing FX business with mainland branches is as follows
50% from CCB Shandong branch,
25% from CCB Hebei branch and 17% from CCB Fujian branch

The new rating system should be carried out to evaluate our chinese customers (Authorize payment and FRP) to get a summary of our internal rating and risk bearing capacity.

Accrued interest for early repayment 
The accrued interest for the early repayment is manually booked in January. It causes the problem of Balance I. The problem is today fixed.

";"Info:
We are still non-trading book bank.
The contracts of sold assets are considered as sub-participant contracts, which means that the obligo limit must not be used to cover the sold assets.

We build up the general provision according to the german law. HO asked for whether we build up more of the general provision till 1%. Mr. Breunig has to check the feasibility.

Foreign Dept finisched the basic information for the Daimler AG.  
Foreign Dept is preparing some documents for the VW business.

Exchange rate of CNY is lowing. The Chinese govement changes the range of the exchange rate of onshore CNY.
The profit of FX business for last week was very small due to down of the RMB exchange rate and decreasing of AP and FRP. 

FRP Contracts: we have the English version . We attach the english version to the signed contracts, new signature is not necessary.  
For the Authorized payment we have  already the English version.

CIC limit calculation in the system is still not correct. We must change it.  Because we will get more and more FX forward business requirements. Mr. Yu suggested to change the system with new method: 1%  of nominal value of FX business and daily revaluation, but with a conservative buffer. This must be decided.

Problem of Online banking-token do not work correctly: We reported to HO, and now report it to HO again and try to give pressure to HO IT to solve the problem.
We tested new function with GMPS--the mainland branches can directly do the payment at their terminals. This will reduce our manual working at the cleaing dept and reduce the operational risk.

Online Obligo in OCBS is still in the process in HO.

We are in the way to complement the new risk bearing capacity.
We will get the rating mapping.
The availble CAR has to be calculated to develop the business. 
We can diversify the business with low risk weight to fufill the budget, e.g. Bonds or Bank loans and so on.

About the capital injection, HO can not tell the exact date, it is in the processing in CBRC.

Mr. Sternheimer visited the Sparkasse in Berlin. The Cooperation with Sparkasse could bring us some business, e.g. credit card business, bilateral business and  foreign business.

Regarding the risk bearing capacity Mr. Nieli talked to Bundesbank Mr. Kirsch and Mrs. Mohn and hinted what the auditors from Bundesbank calculated is not correct. e.g. CCB Prefinancing could not be calculated in the credit portfolio due to the coverage from Liability surplus, the FX business could not be calculated with nominal value, the deposit with Bundesbank and Bundesschatzbrief could not be calculated easily with LGD 45% and so on.

We will wait for the reaction of Bundesbank.

According to the new regulation, LCR (officially in implementation since 01.01.2015) must be more than 0.7.
However we must report the new ratio figure quarterly to the Deutsche Bundesbank. For the first quarter it must be reported at latest on 30.04.2014.

Important difference:
The institution bonds will not be classified as liquidity assets. The company bonds with very good ratings will still be classified as liquidity assets.
Off-balance business will be considered in LCR.

It will bring us more than RMB 1.5 bn which will also bring us the liability surplus problem, because we will place the funds in our account with CCB Shanghai. We must tightly supervise our Liability surplus. and insure that we have the business always in the legal way. Another point is the placement of the fund to get profit.

to Liabilty surplus:
Treasury has borrowed funds from CCB Taibei and CCB Tokyo for 3 months to partially cover the assets with CCB Shanghai and will roll over the deal possibly.

PWC finished the draft of the annual report. Tomorrow we will hold the meeting with PWC.
Mr. Sternheimer has shared with us about the equal treatment of chinese banks - equal supervisory status China from BaFin. This means that we could do the MM with other Chinese banks (excluding: Bank of China ). 

Following is the email from Mr. Sternheimer
Mr. Mestek (BaFin) called yesterday and provided the following information to me: 

•	For the time being (until further notice) BaFin accepts that Chinese Banks exceed the last time reduced Large Exposure Limit of 25 % up to the dotation capital of our Branch
•	This does not mean, that Chinese Banks are treated equal to other institutions from other countries within the EU, US etc. (no equal treatment according to article 391 CRR)
•	The question of equal treatment is still under discussion in BAFIN and EBA and has not yet been decided. 
Therefore our reporting duties have not been changed -  this means that in our reporting we still have to show Chinese banks as “not equal treated banks” with a limit of 25 %
•	Condition: exposures should not exceed a tenor of 3 month
•	Mr. Mestek pointed out, that there still exists the risk, that EBA (or Ministry of Finance) will finally decide that Chinese Banks cannot be treated equal according to article 391 CRR; 
He said he cannot exclude such a result at the end of the day..
•	In such a case we have to report the exceeding amount on request to BaFin, but due to the short term maturity BaFin shall show tolerance and shall not take any penalty action 
against us. 
•	Mr. Mestek asked to treat BaFin´s decision secret and not to spread around. He shall also approach the other Chinese banks to provide the same info to them like he did with our branch. 

Treasury, Risk Management, Compliance, Accounting have already been informed accordingly.

1. Our Head Office will provide USD 1 bn  within one monthrefinance limit to us. The Treasury dept will plan to get USD 400 mil borrowing and place to CCB NY. We could get 0,05% interest gap through these tractions.

2. EURO clearing funds of Head Office
Head Office will place EUR 500 mil as relative stable funds with us. According to the requirment of HO and in order to avoid paying punish interest to Deutsche Bundesbank, treasury dept will purchase German bonds with this EUR 500 mil and place the bonds with Bundesbank. If our Head Office needs the liquidity, we will get the overdraft funds per overnight from Bundesbank as we pledge our bonds with Bundesbank. The overdraft interest rate is 0.4%. Now the booking procedure must be defined and discussed internally, then treasury will do the test firstly.

3. Visiting VW
Mr. Xiaodong Wang discussed with VW about the EURO term deposit and FX business. He also made 3 parties telefone conference with VW and CCB Luxemburg to discuss new transaction model. e.g. VW place the term deposit with CCB Luxemburg and CCB Luxemburg will place the half of the funds with us. This will bring us more liability surplus.

1. Silo
According to the memo from Mr. Gilhaus on 04.07.2014, Bundesbank has withdrawn ICBC and ABC from the SILO list (separated Borrower’s units within PRC). They now belong once again to the Borrower’s Unit PRC since 13.06.2014. As of 30.06.2014 (reporting date for million and large loans), the outstanding of both ABC and ICBC amounts to a total of € 111.6 mil which results in a large loan overdraft of € 37.8 mil.
This large loan overdraft did not result of violation of the large loan rules, but because of the sudden cancellation of the SILOs through the Central Bank.

Mr. Breunig will ask for the opinion of our consultant KPMG.
Mr. Sternheimer said, that a letter to Bundesbank to explain our passive violation about this matter is in preparing.

Because of the interbranch money borrowings (support of the oblogo) by Treasury the credit business could expand.

Nieli Riskmanagement
1) In discussion with KPGM related to the consideration of FX Derivatives business in the Obligo (Liability Surplus) or Large loan exposure.
Riskmanagement is warning for to fast decisions, because the tendency is to switch to obligo. We cannot switch from large loan exposure to obligo or from obligo to large loan exposure every month. Once we made this decision we are bound. Therefore, we have to check if our obligo could stand the FX exposures. There must be approx. 50 to 60 Mil. € buffer zone for the FX exposures. The advantage of the Obligo is the unlimited FX exposure line as long there is enough obligo. But there is also the danger of the violation of the obligo, if we rely on the clearing money of H.O. But also use the special clause of the GroMikv for intergroup loans meaning that only 10% of the exposures are counted in the CIC,  the solution of the large loan exposures is also good for us and furthermore we avoid the discussion of switching to obligo.
2) Commerzbank, Meeting was held last week 12.8.2014. Conversation was good. We will send the old contract and our documentation to Dr. Fischer, he will change the contract according to the auditors oppinion. Before we launch the contract, PWC has to prove it beforehand.
3) German Protection Fund audited ICBC with nearly the same findings  (unexpected loss and concentration risks). In September they will audit BaComm. We think in October or November GPF will audit CCB FFM. We have to get prepared.


Biao Li General management
After two weeks Mr. Biao Li returned from the Mamangement Meeting in China. The main topic was the bad debt/non-performing loans. In the area of following chinese industry sectors CCB detected the danger of default:
-Copper industry
-Aluminium industry
-Steel Industry

We have to be very carefull in choosing our loan engagements. CCB London and CCB Jo'burg are still struggeling with bad debt loans. This circumstances lead to penalties set by CCB H.O.

In the monthly comparision of the overseas branches CCB FFM is in the midfield, ranked No. 8 related to the asset amount.
But our profit increases to slow in order to reach the target profit budget at the end of the year. Compared with ICBC and BaComm CCB FFM has considerably more assets but less profit than ICBC and BaComm. BaComm already has 10 Mil € profit.
After the capital increase with our own retained earnings, there will we be some space for asset increasing, but we have also to consider the profitability of the business 
 
We have to get prepared for the year end. The follow-up of the bundesbank findings have to be finished until the end of the year. We should not rely only on our consultants (avoid high expenses) or on outsourcing/delegation of the problems.

2) LCR is 1,13 and Liquidity key figure (Liquiditätskennziffer) is 1,26, which means both are in “green zone”
3) CIC: inter-branch FX amounted 50Mio, which means a 50% decrease in comparison to 2014
